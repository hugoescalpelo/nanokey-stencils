# nanoKEY stencils

In this repo I store a few designs for 3d printed stencils for my Korg nanoKey2, which I use mainly as macro pad.

## Key stencils

You can find a folder with the STEP files and STL files to 3D print each key stencil. The following keys were designed

- Open OBS
    - Start/Stop Recording
    - Camera Scene
    - Desktop Scene
    - Camera and Desktop Scene
    - Wooow Sound
    - Parkour Sound
    - Link Unlock Secret Sound
    - Name Text toggle
    - Subscribe Text Toggle
    - This video title toggle
- Open GitHub Desktop
- Open Visual Studio Code
    - Open Theme Selector men√∫
    - Open VSC Terminal
    - Insert double inverted aphostrophe (For code blocks in MarkDown)

## Compatibility

I have only tested this stencils on nanoKEY2, but I assume they also work on other versions.
